# ERL-Cellular-Automata-Model
In this study, we examine cell regeneration with cellular automata. Cellular automata was first introduced by Von Neumann, who determined the working principles of today's computer architecture to model the self-renewal capabilities of biological entities. Cellular automata includes a computational model based on state update logic due to interaction with cells around cells in the grid plane. Studies on cellular automata have shown that some situations interact dynamically with other states. Morphogenesis is the process of forming the shape of an organism and Morphogenesis is one of the most striking examples of a phenomenon called self-organization. We are trying to replicate some of the desired features with this artificial intelligence model that we have made, to help solve the morphogenetic code puzzle and also take advantage of biology's insights to create real-life self-healing systems.
